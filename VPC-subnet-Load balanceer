AWS | VPC| Subnet| EC2 | Auto Scaling | Load Balancer

A: VPC
  -Subnet
  - Route table
 - Internet Gateway
 
B: EC2
 - 2 x EC2 machine
  -  1  x EC2 machine Pvt , will Install IIS and attached load balancer
  - 1  x EC2 machine on public

-Deploy Load Balancer

Autoscaling

SNS - Simple Notification system : will send notification to email or phone

with every VPC that is created following 3 things are auto created
- Pvt Route Table
- Network ACL list
- Secuirty Grooup
Keypair is hardware encryption with hardware to server 

Subnet --> RT ---> IGW
========
A: 1: create VPC : cloudhc
create subnet: sns-east2a
creats subnet : sns-east2b
2: After creating both subnets, create route Table
 -create 2 RT , 1 public and 1 prvt and associate with VPC
3: associate pubic subnet with publich RT and pvt subnet with pvt RT

4: create IGW and attached to VPC
5: Come back to Pubic RT . Edit route and define any route"0.0.0.0" and attached IGW
  - It will identify if public subnet idenentfi Internet gateway
  
  
  =======
  B: Now deploy Ec2 machine and perform autoscaling
  Create Pvt Ec2 instance with Windows server 2016 base and RDT , HTPP with anywhere 
  Create Public Ec2 instance with Windows server 2016 base and RDT , HTPP with anywhere 
  
  Download  remote Desktop file and login with Jumpbox machine to give connectivity to Autoscaling machine . Make sure Secuorty groupd associated with Autoscaling 
  has RDP port enabled on Port 3389 
  Get password

Once connected to Remote Desktop using Jump-pwd
Copy pvt IP , open remote desktop , and run mstcs and define pvt ip there

#Installing IIS
Go to Rmote desktop server --> Server manager --> local server --: IE enahnaced secuorty confirg and swith off Admin and user off 

type 10.0.1.86 to check if IIS is working --> Add jumpserver IP to check if IIS is working fine
Now take snapshot and perform Auto-scaling . This is done due to the fact if 1 machine gets terminates then other machine workds fine
In order to take image , stop prvt machine 1st . IIS is made on Pvt , jump box is public
As soon as the Pvt machine stops , take its image also 
Image is used to backup , in case of website is down ,image isued 
Create snapshot , it will create by default of 30G
Once done  , create a pvt subnet in 2a and associate to Pvt route table
Create load balancer , classic load balancer  and assign HTTPs
Load balanceer is attached to public
define a secuirty group for load balancer
Load balancer create end points , but DNS name will not work until any machine gets attached to it 
Now create a launch configuration , selec image auto-scaling under AMI , select t2.micro
Once launce configuration is created with key 
check secutity group of launch configuration whether it has HTTP TCP under Inbound rule
Now go Autoscaling Group and create with existing configuration and select Pvt Subnet 
Create Autoscaling Group 
Create Target group and attached 3 sg-machines to it 
3 machines are attached to load balancer and try DNS
